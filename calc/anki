[latex]What is an open cover?[/latex]	[latex]Let \(S\subseteq\mathbb{R}\). An \textbf{open cover} of \(S\) is a (possibly infinite) collection \(\mathcal{H}\) of open sets \(\{H|H\subseteq\mathcal{H}\}\) whose union covers \(S\), that is \(S\subseteq\cup\{H|H\subseteq\mathcal{H}\}\).[/latex]
[latex]What is a finite subcover?[/latex]	[latex]If \(\mathcal{H}\) is an open cover of a set \(S\), a finite subcover is a finite subcollection of sets from \(\mathcal{H}\) that covers \(S\), i.e. \(S\subseteq\cup\{H_i\}_{i=1}^n\)[/latex]

[latex]Define neighborhood and interior point.[/latex]	[latex]Let \(S\) be a set. If \(S\) contains an \(\epsilon\)-neighborhood of \(x_0\), then S is a neighborhood of \(x_0\) and \(x_0\) is an interior point of \(S\).[/latex]
[latex]What is an open set?[/latex]	[latex]A set \(S\) is open iff every point of \(S\) is an interior point.[/latex]

[latex]What is a limit point?[/latex]	[latex]Let \(S\) be a set, and \(x_0\) a point. \(x_0\) is a limit point of \(S\) if every deleted neighborhood of \(x_0\) contains a point of \(S\).[/latex]
[latex]What is a boundary point?[/latex]	[latex]Let \(S\) be a set, and \(x_0\) a point. \(x_0\) is a boundary point of \(S\) if every neighborhood of \(x_0\) contains a point in \(S\) and a point not in \(S\). The set of boundary point of \(S\) is called the boundary of \(S\) and is written \(\delta S\).[/latex]
[latex]What is the closure of a set \(S\)?[/latex]	[latex]The closure of \(S\), written \(\overline{S}\) is \(S\cup\delta S\).[/latex]
[latex]What is a isolated point?[/latex]	[latex]Let \(S\) be a set, and \(x_0\) a point. \(x_0\) is an isolated point of \(S\) if \(x_0\in S\) and there exists a deleted neighborhood of \(x_0\) that contains no point in \(S\).[/latex]
[latex]What is a exterior point?[/latex]	[latex]Let \(S\) be a set, and \(x_0\) a point. \(x_0\) is an exterior point of \(S\) if \(x_0\) is in the interior of \(S^C\). The collection of all exterior points is the exterior of \(S\).[/latex]
[latex]What is the completeness axiom?[/latex]	[latex]If a nonempty set of reals is bounded above, then it has a supremum.[/latex]
[latex]What is a supremum?[/latex]	[latex]If a nonempty set \(S\) of reals is bounded above, then \(\sup S\) is the unique real number \(\beta\) such that\begin{itemize}\item\(x\leq\beta\forall x\in S\)\item if \(\epsilon>0\), there is an \(x_0\in S\) such that \(x_0>\beta-\epsilon\).\end{itemize}[/latex]

[latex]What is the triangle inequality?[/latex]	[latex]If \(a\) and \(b\) are any two real numbers, then \[|a+b|\leq|a|+|b|.\][/latex]
[latex]Prove that \(\sqrt{p}\) is not rational, where \(p\) is a prime.[/latex]	[latex]For the sake of contradiction, assume that \(\sqrt{p}\) is rational. Then \(p\) can be written in the form \(\frac{q}{r}\), where \(\gcd(q, r) = 1\) and \(q, r \in \mathbb{Z}\). \begin{align*} \sqrt{p} &= \frac{q}{r}\\ p &= \frac{{q}^2}{{r}^2}\\ pr^2&=q^2\\ \end{align*} \(q^2\) is of the form \(pk\), so it has \(p\) as a divisor. This implies that \(q\) is also divisible by \(p\), because \(p\) is prime. Writing \(q\) in the form \(pj, j \in \mathbb{Z}\): \begin{align*} pr^2&=(pj)^2\\ pr^2&= p^2j^2\\ r^2&= pj^2\\ \end{align*} \(r^2\) is of the form \(pk\), where \(k\) is an integer, so \(r^2\) is divisible by \(p\). This implies that \(r\) is also divisible by \(p\). This is a contradiction because we have assumed that \(\gcd(q,r)=1\) but they have a common factor of \(p\).[/latex]
[latex]Let \(S\) and \(T\) be nonempty sets of real numbers such that every real number is in \(S\) or \(T\) and if \(s\in S\) and \(t \in T\), then \(s<t\). Prove that there is a unique real number \(\beta\) such that every real number less than \(\beta\) is in \(S\) and every real number greater than \(\beta\) is in \(T\).[/latex]	[latex]Let \(S\) and \(T\) be nonempty sets of real numbers. Note that if \(s\in S\), it is strictly less than every element of \(T\). Because \(T\) is nonempty, we know that \(S\) is bounded from above. It, therefore, has a supremum.\\Claim: The number \(\beta_0=\sup S\) is the unique real number \(\beta\).\\subproof: Suppose \(x<\beta_0\) and \(x \in T\). As established above, \(s\in S\to s<x\). Then \(x\) is an upper bound of \(S\) that is less than \(S\)'s supremum. Contradiction. So \(x\in T\).\\Suppose \(y>\beta_0\) and \(y\in S\). Then there is an element of \(S\) greater than its supremum. Contradiction. So \(y\in T\).\\\(\beta\) is clearly unique because \(S\) has only a single supremum.[/latex]

Then there exist positive numbers \(\delta_1,\delta_2\) such that \[0<|x-x_0|<\delta_i\to|f(x)-L_i|<\epsilon, i=1,2.\] If \(\delta=\min(\delta_1,\delta_2)\), then \begin{align}|L1-L2|&=|L1-f(x)+f(x)-L2|\\&\leq|L_1-f(x)|+|f(x)-L2|<2\epsilon \mbox{ if } 0<|x-x_0|<\delta\end{align}. We have that \(|L_1-L_2|\), and this holds for any positive \(\epsilon\), so \(L_1=L_2\).[/latex]

Suppose that \[0<|x-x_0|<\delta=\min(\delta_1,\delta_2)\]. Then \begin{align*}|(f\pm g)(x)-(L_1\pm L_2)|&=|f(x)-L_1)\pm(g(x)-L_2)|\\&\leq|f(x)-L_1|+|g(x)-L_2|<2\epsilon,\end{align*} proving the first two.\\\begin{align*}|(fg)(x)-L_1L_2|&=|f(x)g(x)-L_1L_2|\\&=|f(x)(g(x)-L_2)+L_2(f(x)-L_1)|\\&\leq|f(x)||g(x)-L_2|+|L_2||f(x)-L_1|\\&\leq(|f(x)|+|L_2|)\epsilon\\\leq(|f(x)-L_1|+|L_1|+|L_2|)\epsilon\\\leq(\epsilon+|L_1|+|L_2|)\epsilon\\\leq(1+|L_1|+|L_2|)\epsilon\end{align*} if \(\epsilon<1\).\\\begin{align*} |cf(x)-cL|&=|c(f(x)-L|\\ &=|c||f(x)-L|\\ &<|c|\varepsilon \end{align*}[/latex]
[latex]Define continuity, left-continuity and right-continuity[/latex]	[latex]\begin{itemize}\item A function \(f\) is continuous at \(x_0\) if and only if \(f\) is defined on an open interval \((a,b)\) containing \(x_0\) and for each \(\epsilon>0\) there is a \(\delta\) such that \[|f(x)-f(x_0)|<\epsilon\] whenever \(|x-x_0|<\delta\).\item A function \(f\) is continuous from the right at \(x_0\) if and only if \(f\) is defined on the interval \([x_0,b)\) and for each \(\epsilon>0\) there is a \(\delta>0\) such that \(|f(x)-f(x_0)|<\epsilon\) holds whenever \(x_0\leq x < x_0+\delta\).\item A function \(f\) is continuous from the left at \(x_0\) if and only if \(f\) is defined on the interval \((a,x_0]\) and for each \(\epsilon>0\) there is a \(\delta>0\) such that \(|f(x)-f(x_0)|<\epsilon\) holds whenever \(x_0-\delta<x\leq x_0\).\end{itemize}[/latex]
[latex]How is continuity on an interval related to boundedness?[/latex]	[latex]If \(f\) is continuous on a finite closed interval \([a, b]\), then \(f\) is bounded on \([a,b]\)[/latex]
[latex]State and prove the intermediate value theorem.[/latex]	[latex]Suppose that \(f\) is continuous on \([a,b], f(a)\ne f(b)\), and \(\mu\) is between \(f(a)\) and \(f(b)\). Then \(f(c)=\mu\) for some \(c\) in \((a,b)\). \begin{proof}Suppose that \(f(a)<\mu<f(b)\). The set \[S=\{x|a\leq x\leq b \mbox{ and } f(x)\leq \mu\}\] is bounded and nonempty. Let \(c=\sup S\). We will show that \(f(c)=\mu\). If \(f(c)>\mu\), then \(c>a\) and, since \(f\) is continuous at \(c\), there is an \(\epsilon>0\) such that \(f(x)>\mu\) if \(c-\epsilon<x\leq c\). Therefore, \(c-\epsilon\) is an upper bound for \(S\), which contradicts the definition of \(c\) as the supremum of \(S\). If \(f(c)<\mu\), then \(c<b\) and there is an \(\epsilon>0\) such that \(f(x)<\mu\) for \(c\leq x < c+\epsilon\), so \(c\) is not an upper bound for \(S\). This is also a contradiction. Therefore, \(f(c)=\mu\).\\The proof for the case where \(f(b)<\mu<f(a)\) can be obtained by applying this result to \(-f\).\end{proof}[/latex]
